A wordpress plugin that autoscans the basechain for new pairs. For the testing 
phase the widget uses openai's api to scan the contracts for known scams, exploits 
and identical contracts and their status. Ideally I would prefer using token sniffer, but the cost is much to high.

I plan to add more in-depth options but this is version .0001
